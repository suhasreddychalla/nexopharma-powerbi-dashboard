# ðŸ“Š NexoPharma Supply Chain Simulation Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard simulates a 4-tier pharmaceutical supply chainâ€”from supplier to customerâ€”offering real-time visualization of demand fulfillment, inventory performance, and key operational KPIs.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

**Objective:**  
To model and visualize a simulated supply chain for a pharmaceutical company using Power BI, with the goal of identifying bottlenecks, optimizing inventory levels, and tracking critical performance metrics like Fill Rate and Stockouts.

**Scope Includes:**
- EOQ and Safety Stock calculations (via Excel inputs)
- 12-week inventory flow simulation
- Demand vs Order alignment analysis
- Power BI dashboard with advanced visual storytelling

## ðŸ“Š Key Visuals in Dashboard

- **Forecasted Demand vs Order Quantity**  
  Compares actual order placements against predicted demand.

- **Ending Inventory Over Time**  
  Area chart showing inventory levels post fulfillment weekly.

- **KPI: Fill Rate (%)**  
  Measures service level: proportion of demand fulfilled on time.

- **Stockout Count Indicator**  
  Highlights weeks where inventory was insufficient.

- **Backorders by Week**  
  Bar chart showing unfulfilled units across the 12-week simulation.
